# montreal-rental-location
## Overview
A data-driven Power BI project that helps renters and property stakeholders identify optimal rental locations in Montreal using multi-criteria analysis.

## Context
Renters on the Island of Montreal face difficulty selecting a borough that aligns with their needs due to fragmented data, inconsistent indicators, and limited tools for objective comparison. Critical factors such as affordability, safety, commute time, and access to public services are often evaluated in isolation, increasing decision risk.

## Objective
To deliver a unified, data driven decision platform that enables renters to objectively compare Montreal boroughs and identify the locations that best match their individual priorities.

## Solution
An interactive Power BI dashboard that consolidates public and third party data into a single view. Users prioritize key criteria—such as rental price, safety, accessibility, transportation, education, and daycare—and the platform recommends the top three boroughs with clear explanations for each recommendation.

## Tools
- Power BI / Microsoft Fabric
- SQL / Python
- Git & Power BI Dev Mode

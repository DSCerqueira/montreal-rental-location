            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>
              This project delivers a data-driven dashboard to help renters,
              families, newcomers, and shared households identify the borough on
              the Island of Montreal that best fits their needs. By
              consolidating rental prices, safety, commute times, and access to
              schools, daycare, and public services, the dashboard enables
              objective comparison and prioritization of boroughs based on
              individual preferences. Success is measured by ease of use, data
              reliability, and meaningful insights that guide informed rental
              decisions. It showcases the end-to-end process—from data gathering
              and transformation to modeling and visualization.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Finding a suitable rental on the Island of Montreal is a complex
              task for individuals, families, and shared households. Factors
              such as rental prices, safety, commute times, and access to
              essential services like schools and daycare vary widely across
              boroughs. This information is often scattered across multiple
              sources, making it challenging for renters to objectively compare
              locations and identify the areas that best meet their needs and
              priorities. Although this information is available online, there
              is currently no tool that integrates all these factors and
              evaluates locations according to individual requirements.
            </p>

            <hr class="major" />

            <h2>Business Objectives</h2>
            <p>
              The objective of this case study is to design and deliver a
              data-driven dashboard that consolidates multiple public and
              third-party data sources to help renters identify the most
              suitable borough on the Island of Montreal based on their
              individual priorities.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Simplify rental location decision-making</li>
              <li>
                Compare Montreal boroughs using standardized and objective
                indicators
              </li>
              <li>
                Prioritize factors based on individual needs (e.g.,
                affordability vs. commute time)
              </li>
              <li>
                Identify boroughs that offer the best overall balance of cost,
                accessibility, safety, and quality of life
              </li>
              <li>
                Support landlords to determine competitive rental pricing based
                on their apartment’s location.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The dashboard should recommend at least three locations for users,
              ranked from top 1 to 3, and provide explanations for why each
              location was selected.
            </p>

            <hr class="major" />

            <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
            <p>
              The project aims to gather data for eight key criteria: price,
              safety, commute time, walkability, public transportation, school
              availability, secondary school grades, and daycare availability.
            </p>
            <p>
              The methodology is based on ranking Montreal locations for each
              criterion and scoring them according to both their rank and the
              relevance assigned by the user. Users can easily select the
              criteria most important to them and assign a weight— ranging from
              zero, low, medium, moderate, to high—to indicate its importance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the criteria and weights are set, the dashboard highlights
              the top three recommended locations and provides explanations for
              why each location was selected. Users can explore different
              configurations to identify the location that best fits their
              needs. Additionally, the dashboard reveals less obvious
              characteristics of boroughs that may be important for
              decision-making.
            </p>

                may be confusing. Mitigation: provide clear instructions,
                tooltips, and examples.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Analytical Bias:</strong> Certain criteria may dominate
                rankings. Mitigation: ensure transparency and test multiple
                weighting scenarios.
              </li>
            </ul>

              <li>Integrate devop pipeline to GitHub</li>
            </ul>

            <hr class="major" />

            <h2>Project Continuous Development</h2>
            <p>
              There are many additional insights that can be incorporated into
              this project; therefore, continuous review of the project’s
              objectives, requirements, and KPIs is essential. The next phase of
              dashboard development will focus on expanding the criteria used to
              evaluate rental locations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following dimensions are planned for inclusion in the next
              version:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Household income by location</li>
              <li>Age group distribution</li>
              <li>Official language by location</li>
              <li>Availability of hospitals and healthcare centers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In a subsequent version, machine learning techniques will be
              applied to identify relationships between these criteria and
              rental prices. While the current dashboard supports renters in
              identifying locations based on their personal priorities, the next
              iteration will also support property owners by estimating expected
              rental prices based on location-specific characteristics.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the development perspective, the project will adopt Power BI
              Developer Mode with Git integration to support collaborative
              development and establish a scalable, multi-developer analytics
              framework.
            </p>

            <hr class="major" />

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Finding a suitable borough in Montreal is challenging for renters
              due to fragmented information and limited visibility into
              location-related issues. This solution addresses the problem by
              providing a unified, data-driven dashboard that helps tenants
              evaluate and compare locations based on key criteria such as
              price, safety, accessibility, transportation, commute time, and
              education services.
            </p>
            <p>
              By prioritizing their needs, users receive clear recommendations
              for the top three locations that best match their preferences,
              along with explanations and access to rental listings. The
              platform reduces decision risk and enables more confident,
              informed rental choice.

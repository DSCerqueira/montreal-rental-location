              This case study focuses on helping individuals, families, and
              shared households identify the borough on the Island of Montreal
              that best matches their rental needs. By combining housing prices,
              safety, accessibility, commute time, and access to public
              services, the project delivers a data-driven decision-support
              dashboard to guide renters toward the most suitable location.

            </header>
            <p>
              Finding a suitable place to rent on the Island of Montreal is a
              complex decision for individuals, families, and shared households.
              Rental prices, safety, commute time, and access to essential
              services such as schools and daycare vary significantly across
              boroughs.
            </p>
            <p>
              This information is often fragmented across multiple sources,
              making it difficult for renters to objectively compare locations
              and identify the area that best meets their personal needs and
              constraints.

              The objective of this case study is to design and deliver a
              data-driven dashboard that consolidates multiple public and
              third-party data sources to help renters identify the most
              suitable borough on the Island of Montreal based on their
              individual priorities.
